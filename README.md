Websites
=============
A collection of old websites I've made.
Mostly non-serious. Take with a grain of salt.

There's a long story behind this site. The short
version is that they were all made in high school
between all the different computer classes I had. 
When I wasn't paying attention, I was just fiddling
with HTML.

This was my final for a High School HTML class.
Made in Adobe Dreamweaver, though if it weren't for
the tacky menubar, it wouldn't have required 
Dreamweaver at all...

A mockup site I threw together for my personal game
servers. It was a fun idea that never came to be.

This is a remake of the below. It is a set of pages
I made to test any web servers I make.

A website I made for an old E-Sports team. I had croned
our team server to sync recordings of our games, or 
in-game "demos", to a folder. The folders contents would
be parsed by the demos.php page and give download links. 
This was useful for when we wanted to review our games, 
and our players could all get a recording from the same 
source if they didn't have their own.
